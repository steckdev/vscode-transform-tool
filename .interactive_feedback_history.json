    "summary": "Quick Q: I've completely refactored the extension to work the way you requested:\n\n**Changes:**\n1. Created `src/transformers.ts` - Server-side transformation functions (no webview needed)\n2. Updated `src/extension.ts` - Now creates new unsaved documents with transformed content\n3. Removed webview dependency from the transform command\n\n**How it works now:**\n- Click a transformation in the sidebar OR use \"Transform Selected Text\"\n- Extension reads current file/selection\n- Applies transformation\n- Opens result in a new unsaved document (beside current editor)\n- User can review, copy, or save the result\n\n**Benefits:**\n- \u2705 Much simpler and faster\n- \u2705 No webview rendering issues\n- \u2705 Direct file-to-file workflow\n- \u2705 All transformations work server-side\n\nReady to test? You can reload the extension window (Cmd+R in Extension Development Host) to try it out.\n\nRecommended commit message:\n```\nrefactor: replace webview UI with direct document transformation\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: Transform tool now creates new unsaved documents instead of webview panel\n\n- Add server-side transformers in src/transformers.ts\n- Update extension.ts to create untitled documents with results\n- Simplify workflow: file \u2192 transform \u2192 new document\n- Remove webview dependency from transform command\n- Faster and more reliable transformation process\n```",

I've added Command Palette support for all transformations:\n\n**New Commands Available (Cmd+Shift+P):**\n- Transform Tool: JSON to TypeScript\n- Transform Tool: JSON to Zod Schema\n- Transform Tool: JSON to GraphQL\n- Transform Tool: JSON to MySQL Schema\n- Transform Tool: JSON to Mongoose Schema\n- Transform Tool: JavaScript Object to JSON\n- Transform Tool: JavaScript Object to TypeScript\n- Transform Tool: YAML to JSON\n- Transform Tool: YAML to TOML\n- Transform Tool: TOML to YAML\n- Transform Tool: TOML to JSON\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Open any file or select text\n2. Press Cmd+Shift+P\n3. Type \"Transform Tool\" to see all commands\n4. Select the transformation you want\n5. New unsaved document opens with the result\n\n**Smart Content Detection:**\n- If text is selected \u2192 transforms selection\n- If no selection \u2192 transforms entire file\n- Opens result in new editor beside current file\n\nThe sidebar tree view still works too! You can use whichever method you prefer.\n\nReady to test? Reload the extension window to try the new commands.\n\nRecommended commit message:\n```\nfeat: add Command Palette commands for all transformations\n\n- Add 11 new commands accessible via Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P)\n- Smart content detection: transforms selection or entire file\n- All commands create new unsaved documents with results\n- Sidebar tree view still available as alternative UI\n- Commands: JSON/JS/YAML/TOML transformations to TypeScript, Zod, GraphQL, SQL, etc.\n```",
